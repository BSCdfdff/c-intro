    "\n",
    "Lest explore..int Net v1 there was no generics...so we had the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a list to store a list of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can create a simple basic list...\n",
    "\n",
    "So have the the followinf method in our class \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add method to add a number to list\n",
    "2. \"indexer\" give the number at a given index\n",
    "\n",
    "We cn also have other methods like remove and find...but we leaving that out to concentrate on the main issue at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets say we want to store or add strings in this list..this class will not work. It can only accept integers. We will need to create another class for this. (Create StringList)\n",
    "\n",
    "So as we can see for every data type you need to create  new class with that data type...and we are duplicating code.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we solvee this..\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can create a list of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "(Since object is the parent class of any class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adn when it is declard as a object we can pass many type to it, but there is performance hit problem. So when we store a value type (as mentioned in the earlier lessons) it has to boxed, to be stored as an object. And when we need to access that value it needs to be unboxed. And this has a performance penalty"
