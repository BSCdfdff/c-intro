    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "But by adding this extra line, we make break things along the way\n",
    "    .\n",
    "We can use events to resolve this issue...\n",
    "\n",
    "But we first need to define a few terms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Publisher (class that will publish an event) [SENDER]\n",
    "2. Subscriber (class that will subscribe to an event) [RECEIVER]\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. By adding a new class (SMSMessageService)\n",

    "Lets add the eventing mechanism.\n",

    "But what mechanism does VideoEncoder use to notify its subscribers? It will need to send a message to its subscribers, but in c# terms: Invoking a method in the subscriber\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does Videoencoder knows which method (in the subscriber) to call/invoke?\n",
    "\n",
    "That information will be kept in a CONTRACT or agreement between the publisher and sibscribers.\n",

    "WE need a method will a specific signature.\n",

    " \n",
    "1. Public and Void\n",

    "And these methods are called Event handlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "THIS is the method that is called by the publisher, when the event is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember its VideoEncoder is still loosely coupled. It does  not know anything about MailService, it only know about a \"method\"\n",
    "\n",
    "And what is the syntax that we use ny VideoEncoder to call this method...we use a Delegate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The delegate:\n",
    "1. Enforces or put into affect the contract or agreement between the publisher and subscriber.\n",
    "2. Specifies the signature of the event handler method in subscriber.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have a delegate in VideoEncoder, that has signature of the method (defined about), that is with the argument (object source, EventArgs e). The delegate must have the signature of the event handler \"method\". Name does not matter, BUT it must have this signature (as we have learnt before of hoe delegates are implemented)\n",

    "## Lets implement and Event using a delegate....let s start coding\n",

    "1. VideoEncoder class, accepts the video, does the encoding\n",
    "2. Video class, contains the Title of video\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to implement an event in the VideoEncoder, such that, when the encoding is finish, it notifies any one that is interested in this event\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But in order for this class to publish an event, we need to implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a delegate (that specifies the contract (what contract involves))\n",
    "2. Define an event based on that delegate\n",
    "\n",
    "(Aside: Edit Above is correct, this event is event that is defined in publisher. We also have an EventHandler that is defined in the subscriber, with its mandatory syntax signature on which the delegate is based on)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Raise or publish the event\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets emplement each of these steps\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Define a delegate\n",
    "\n",
    "We in the VideoEncoder class (publisher)\n",
    "\n",
    "We define delegate, by specifying public, keyword delegate, and we think of syntax when we declare a method..this is what we keep in mind agter the keyword delegate, this is when we need to make sure we get the method, which is will be the event(handler) in the subscriber  signature correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. public \n",
    "2. keyword delegate\n",
    "3. Next how we declare a method\n",
    "4. Where source is the class that sends the event\n",
    "5. Where args are any additonal data we want to send to event.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public delegate [how we declare a method, with void/returntype, name, and arguments] \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public delegate void VideoEncodedEventHandler(object source, EventArgs args)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So what have we done? We have declared a delegate (in publsiher), which contains a reference to the Eventhandler method in the subscriber class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply the delegate contains a reference to method or function with the above signature, that method is void, it has two paremeters, and 1st one MUST be of type object, and second one MUST be of type EventArgs.\n",
    "\n",
    "How did we choose the name of method? By convention...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First part: Name Method (VideoEncoded)\n",
    "2. Second part: Append EventHandler (EventHandler)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Next define an event\n",
    "\n",
    "We still in the VideoEncoder class (publisher).We need to define an event (not event handler) that is based on that delegate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So define public, keyword event, and that is base on the delegate, so we specify that name of that delegate next, then then the name of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Has the following syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "1. public\n",
    "2. keyword event\n",
    "3. delegate name on which the event is based\n",
    "4. name of the event\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public event VideoEncodedEventHandler VideoEncoded;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Next raise the event\n",
    "\n",
    "We still in the VideoEncoder class (publisher)\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise an event, we need a method that is responsible for it. So we created that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The .NET convention is to start with ```protect virtual void```. And we start the name of the event method with ```On```, followed by the name of the event, specified above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stax of that method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. protected\n",
    "2. virtual \n",
    "3. void\n",
    "4. Name of method, prefixed with \"On\"\n",
    "5. Followed by the name of the event\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "protected virtual void OnVideoEncoded() {}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So once the encoding is finished, we will call this (OnVideoEncoded) method, and the event chain starts....\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OnVideoEncoded();\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And this method will notify all the sibscribers.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we notify subscribers? That will be the responsibility of ```OnVideoEncoded()``` method\n",
    "\n",
    "We start first with checking if there are any subscribers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if VideoEncoded !=null..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and we treat this (event)(this is with brackets) as a method call..., and remember the arguments are object (source) and EventArgs(args). So the source here will be, the publisher, and who is the publisher, it will be this class, VideoEncoder, i.e. this, and we do not have any Eventargs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "VideoEncoded(this,Eventargs.Empty )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete code from above snippets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "protected virtual void OnVideoEncoded() {\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "We defined a delegate with the signature of the Eventhandler method in the subscriber class, Then we created an event based on that delegate. (This is the event that will be raised by the publisher). Then we raise the event though a method, that first will check for subscriber, and if it find them, then the event will be called like method, this method has same signature as delegate method, which in turn has same signature as eventhandler method in subscriber.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create subscribers\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to create subscribers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MailService class, sending an email once the video is encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember her we need a method that confirms with the delegate signature.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "public void OnVideoEncodedEv(object source, EventArgs e){\n",
    "    Console.WriteLine(\"Email sent to user\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What are we missing....how does the subscriber subscribe.. we do it in the main method\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we have\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "var videoEncoder = new VideoEncoder();   //publisher\n",
    "var mailService = new MailService();    //subscriber\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we do the encode method, we need to do the subscription....again some syntax..\n",
    "\n",
    "Suntax\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Event as defined in publisher (\"publisher.event\")\n",
    "2. Asignment ```+=``` operator\n",
    "3. Followed by method in Mailservice\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "videoEncoder.VideoEncoded += mailService.OnVideoEncodedEv;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a reference or pointer to that method,see there is no brackets, that means we not calling it.\n",
    "\n",
