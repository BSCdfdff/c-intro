    "\n",
    "Not the same as method overloading, where we changin the signature of method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement method overriding we use the virtual and override keywords...\n",
    "\n",
    "We do 2 things\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We decorate the method in the base case with a ```virtual``` keyword\n",
    "1. And we decoarte the method in the derived class with ```override``` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we can change the implementation in the derived class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets go back to coding...with shape class below.\n",

    "   1. We need to update the ShapeType Enum\n",
    "   2. We need to add another case statement in Drawshapes method in Canvas class.\n",
    "   \n",
    "That means everytime we get a new shape, the Canvas class wil have to be changed and have to be recompiled. And ALL classes that are dependent on it will have to be recompiled, and recompiled. Same with ShapeType\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem, the case statement, will get very large for all the different types of shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reason we hve these problems, is that the Shape class only have properties, there are no behaviour. Encapsulation says we need to encapsulate all things in a class.\n",

    "//Code spefic to cicle class can be written here.\n",
    "base.Draw();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Above the ```base.Draw()``` method we can write any code specific to the Circle class\n",
    "2. The we pass executed to draw method of the parent class\n",

    "So we get the algorithm for drawing the circle and rect from the Canvas class, and what do we put in place...we add the Circle class draw method. And this is were the magic happens.\n",

    "foreach(var shape in shapes){\n",
    "   shape.Draw();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Essence: We dont need a case statement for each shape, i.e specific shape, we call the base class draw method, and since each shape class override it, it will call the overridden draw method specific to it...this is powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "So shape.Draw() will become circle.Draw(). So whatever shape is passed, the draw method of that shape, e.g. Circle will be called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Behaviour lives in class it belong\n",
    "2. No need for switch/case statements\n",
