    "1. So instead of using the class keyword, we use the ```interface``` keyword\n",
    "2. Recommended, all interface names start with a letter ```I```\n",
    "3. Interfaces do not have implementation.\n",

    "\n",

    "Restuarant needs chef, but if we have any person with the skills of chef, then anyone can apply for that role, since we have seprated the chef from the restuarent. So the dependency between chef and restuarent is loose. So if he gets sick or want to move on, we can get another chef.\n",
